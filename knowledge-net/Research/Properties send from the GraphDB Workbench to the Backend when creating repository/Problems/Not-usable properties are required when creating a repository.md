There are properties that are required for creating a repository.
They cannot be set via the GraphDB Workbench and are probably not used.

Those are  defined in the  [[Properties send from the GraphDB Workbench to the Backend when creating repository#Observations]]
and are marked with a `no` value for the "Configurable / Used" column.
